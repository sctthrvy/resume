%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Projects}

\begin{rSubsection}{SBUnix, {\em C/x86-64 Preemptive OS}}{{\em Spring 2015}}{}{}
\item Implemented COW forking, 64 bit ELF loading, ring-3 userland, timesliced prememption.
\item Developed a shell with sleep/kill/ps, standard library, read-only FS, pipes, auto-growing stack.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{File Descriptor Daemon, {\em C Networking}}{{\em Winter 2014}}{}{}
\item Designed a daemon which allows under privileged processes to obtain raw and packet sockets.
\item Created to replace setuid or NET\_CAP\_RAW on a machine intended for packet socket programming.
%\item Also supports other dangerous tasks such as opening and sending arbitrary files.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{On Demand Routing, {\em C Networking}}{{\em Fall 2014}}{}{}
\item Programmed a shortest-hop routing protocol to replace IP in static networks of unknown connectivity.
%\item Used packet sockets to discover routes and forward application payloads.
%\item Local ODR server performed the routing and multiplexed messages to apps using local sockets.
\item Used packet sockets for route discovery and forwarding; local sockets for delivering payloads to apps.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{xTCP, {\em C Networking}}{{\em Fall 2014}}{}{}
\item Implemented a reliable byte-stream transport protocol over UDP, based off TCP Reno.
\item Featured smoothed-RTT based retransmission timeout and fast retransmission.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{TravelociRaptor, {\em Java Webapp}}{{\em Spring 2014}}{}{}
\item Created a flight reservation and reverse auction webapp using JSP, SQL, and Bootstrap.
\item Designed the MySQl database to support customers, employees, and managers.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Nachos, {\em Java OS}}{{\em Fall 2013}}{}{}
\item Worked on modules of a Java OS which ran COFF binaries using a MIPS emulator.
%\item Implemented paging and virutal memory 
\item Added virtual memory, a program loader, various syscalls, a write-back cache and a disk driver.
%\item Implemented a persistent file system, including a consistency check akin to fsck.
%\item Extended the cpu to support switchable (at boot-time) scheduling hueristics.
%\item Implemented switchable c-look, c-scan disk I/O scheduling.
%\item Loaded compiled C programs on/off disk, initializing their virtual address space.
%\item Extended the kernel and MIPS syscall interface to trap new syscalls provided to C user programs. Created mmap, munmap, yield, join, exec, read,write, exit, ...
%\item Logged stats of user threads: number of disk I/Oâ€™s, time spent in kernel mode, blocked, user mode.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Spriter, {\em Java Application}}{{\em Fall 2012}}{}{}
\item Created a 2D drawing editor using Swing to create sequences of poses for animating game sprites.
\item Completed from an unfinished and broken starting state of 25+ classes.
%\item Saved/loaded sprites into internal XML files based on shapes drawn.
%\item Added exporting to sequential PNGs based on animation, for 2D game use.
\end{rSubsection}
